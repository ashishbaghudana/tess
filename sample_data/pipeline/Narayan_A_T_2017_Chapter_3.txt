there is an analytical closed form solution for radial waveguides that can be used for solar thermal desalination . also discussed are simulation for ray trace analysis , loss mechanisms associated with waveguides , and a cost model for waveguide economics . a parametric study considered net thermal power from the waveguide to the receiver , col- lection efficiency , and aperture area requirements for the system . feasible design and operational envelopes of the radial planar waveguide concentrator-receiver system are reported based on the structural and thermal constraints , like grating size , waveguide thickness and radius , and receiver radius . the results from this analytical model are backed up by tracepro simulations .
