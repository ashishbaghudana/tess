experimental setups for optimization and parametric studies include the agmd mod- ule and superhydrophobic surface . an air-cooled air gap membrane distillation system works well , with lower energy requirements , due to its modular design . the conductivity of the support mesh is an important factor in flux values , with copper mesh giving good yield . furthermore , increasing the air gap reduces the flux value . a hydrophobic surface with small air gap in series configuration , which reduces the temperature drop of the saline water , works best and results in about three times more yield when compared to a single pass water-cooled system .
