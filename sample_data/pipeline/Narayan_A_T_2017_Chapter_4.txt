air-cooled agmd systems with modular design have lower energy requirements than water-cooled counterparts while still giving comparable performance . conductivity of the support mesh had a significant effect on the yield of freshwater . copper meshes performed the best followed by aluminum and steel . desalination can be made more sustainable by using a solar energy concentration system . an analytical model for radial waveguide based solar concentration , to make the process sustainable , was developed . a parametric study considered net thermal power delivered to the receiver from the waveguide , collec- tion efficiency , and aperture area requirement . a cost model was developed to minimize levelized cost of power ( lcop ) . future studies , including of manufacturing , could further improve yields and validate use in natural environments .
