with increasing pressure on freshwater resources , seawater desalination is becoming an important research area to meet the water needs of the world . membrane distillation is a promising process which could be extensively used for desalination in the future because of its versatility and resistance to fouling . of many membrane distillation techniques , air gap membrane distillation is shown to be the most energy efficient . air-cooled systems for agmd are compared against water-cooled systems . to make the desalination process sustainable , solar energy , concentrated with optical waveguides , can be used to meet the thermal needs of the cooling system , thus reducing cost .
